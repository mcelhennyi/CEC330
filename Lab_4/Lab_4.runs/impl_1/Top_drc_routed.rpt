2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer BTND_IBUF_inst has no loads. An input buffer must drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#2 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer BTNU_IBUF_inst has no loads. An input buffer must drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net logic_map/eqOp is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin logic_map/LED7_reg_i_1/O, cell logic_map/LED7_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sequencer_map/AN[5] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sequencer_map/FLAG_an_reg_i_2/O, cell sequencer_map/FLAG_an_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sequencer_map/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sequencer_map/Disp7_reg[3]_i_1/O, cell sequencer_map/Disp7_reg[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sequencer_map/SEG[6][0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sequencer_map/test_count_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell sequencer_map/test_count_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sequencer_map/flag_00 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sequencer_map/flag_0_reg_i_1/O, cell sequencer_map/flag_0_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sequencer_map/flag_15_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sequencer_map/flag_15_reg/L3_2/O, cell sequencer_map/flag_15_reg/L3_2 (in sequencer_map/flag_15_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sequencer_map/flag_17_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sequencer_map/flag_17_reg_i_1/O, cell sequencer_map/flag_17_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RTSTAT-10#1 Warning
No routable loads  
2 net(s) have no routable loads. The problem bus(es) and/or net(s) are BTND_IBUF, BTNU_IBUF.
Related violations: <none>
